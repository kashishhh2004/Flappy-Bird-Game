# Flappy Bird Game

This is a simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. The game features a bird that the player must control to avoid pipes and survive as long as possible. The player controls the bird by pressing the spacebar to make it fly and avoid obstacles.

## Features

- The bird continuously falls due to gravity and can be made to fly by pressing the spacebar.
- Pipes move from right to left, and their positions are random.
- The player must avoid colliding with the pipes to continue.
- The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as the bird successfully navigates through pipes.
- The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
